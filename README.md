# JavaScript Learning Journey

Welcome to my JavaScript Learning Journey repository.  
Here, I document my daily progress, challenges, and projects as I learn and master modern JavaScript — the language of the web.

---

## Objective
This repository is part of my continuous effort to strengthen my skills in:
- JavaScript fundamentals (variables, loops, functions, etc.)
- DOM manipulation and interactive UI behavior
- ES6+ features and best practices
- Building real-world, browser-based mini projects

Every folder reflects what I have learned step by step, from the basics to more advanced concepts.


Each folder includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files created during daily practice.
